Idiot's guide to running Machinekit GUI

*Axis is known to be a resource hog
*I'm using 'keystick' by setting "display=keystick" instead of "display=axis" in the sim.ini file
*In Gnome terminal in order to access the F1 key you need to disable keyboard shortcuts (Edit->Preferences->Shortcuts and uncheck the enable shortcuts box)

*Before you can do anything with the gui you need to

1 Disable ESTOP by pushing F1 key (this clears ESTOP and shows 'ESTOP RESET')
2 Turn on the machine with F2 key (this clears ESTOP RESET and shows ON)
3 Press 'Z' key then 'Home' key (for some reason you have to home Z first)
4 Press 'X' key then 'Home' key
4 Press 'Y' key then 'Home' key
